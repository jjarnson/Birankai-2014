					<h3>The Inception</h3><br />
					<b>A BOWL OF BIRAN</b>
					<hr>
					<b>Heavenly Gift</b><br />
					<i>The note below is featured on the inside cover of the 2001 USAF WR calendar.</i><br /><br />
					At the 1997 French Summer Camp in Mejannes le Clap, one of the senior French instructors asked me to give a name to an international Aikido community whose size was growing rapidly with each passing year. The community has coming into being naturally. It has progressed into an international family with a strong and distinguishable character through an interchange of instructors from the USAF Western Region, British Aikikai, and various French dojos along with their associate members in Greece, Switzerland, and Germany.
					<br /><br />
					Naming this community was needed partly because of the European political situation where organizational control is very rigid surrounding Aikido. It includes control by the government which tends to kill the free and open flow of the students-teacher relationship which of the utmost priority in our Aikido activity. Because of that situation, many concerned members have been looking for a new direction away from the current state of confusion and unhappiness there. They have been looking for a sense of identity in their Aikido lives. 
					<br /><br />
					After two years of careful thought, I chose the name Birankai. Biran is a Buddhist term meaning a cosmic storm that occurs in the moment before cosmic order shifts. It is a force of recovery, spontaneously manifesting itself to restore order. The storm can be powerful and violent. Yet, at the same time it is one that heals through cleansing and purification. In January 2000, I decided to formally start Birankai, taking advantage of the millennium and Year of the Dragon. During the USAF Western Region Summer Camp held in San Diego in June 2000, I appointed Dr. Rikko Varjan to be first head member of Birankai family. 
					<br /><br />
					<img id="bowl" src="images/biran-bowl.png" width="350px" height="" alt="bowl" />
					<br />
					The bowl shown here encircled by three patterns, perfectly satisfies my vision of Biran. In the center, a powerful spiral energy arises out of a mysterious background of three colours: ash white, deep green and blue. The second pattern (as if done with a knife or spatula) surrounds it with smoky brown flower petals that are beautifully stained with deep green and blue from the center, like an aura shooting forth the spiral energy. The pattern reminds me of the effects of amida yasuri (Buddha's aura), often radiating outward in the work of Japanese tsuba. The light brown base blends with these three colours again to appear like a spreading stain. Overall, strong firing and smoky effects without any obvious glaze work makes it beautiful mysterious. The bowl's contour is gradually raised from the base to the outer rim at 40 degrees, simultaneously expressing expansion and contraction, or forces of centripetal and centrifugal energy. 
					<br /><br />
					I can't be sure of the bowl's origins, but it looks to me to be Bizen or Tamba pottery of Japan. I had found it sitting amongst some rubbish in the middle of my garage in the summer of 1999, just about the same time that I chose the name Biran. It came with such perfect timing and coincidence, I first thought. Later, I learned that my wife found it on top of a garbage can in a neighbourhood alley. It surely happened to be a gift from Heaven with a blessing for Birankai.

					<h3>The Birth</h3><br />
					<i>The following speech was originally delivered at the Birankai International seminar held at Labaroche, France in April 2001.</i>
					<br /><br />
					Birankai International represents the culmination of a long-held wish of Chiba Sensei. He has long desired that his students, who are scattered across the globe, should have a single organization to support their training.
					<br /><br />
					In the United States, his students have had the benefit of his presence for 20 years. Under his guidance they have created a strong organization, the USAF Western Region, dedicated to practice and to the transmission of the art. The Western Region organization includes a Teaching Committee, which Chiba Sensei chairs, a Sub-Teaching Committee, and an Advisory Council, as well as a strong and supportive general membership. In the UK, British Aikikai is directed by Sensei's senior teachers, formally brought together into a Technical Committee. Under his supervision, they have been working diligently for a number of years.
					<br /><br />
					Now, for the first time, Sensei has brought the teachers in continental Europe together to form a Teaching Committee. The members of that committee are: Patrick Barthelemy, Gabriel Valibouze, Didier Hatton (France), and Chris Mooney (UK). Steve Magson (UK) has been designated to assist Chris Mooney, although he will not be a member of the committee. Additionally, Chiba Sensei, Norberto Chiesa (France) and Daniel Brunner (Switzerland) have formed an Advisory Committee. Its function will be to advise and assist the members of the continental Europe Teaching Committee. 
					<br /><br />
					These committees, plus others that may be created in the next few years, are charged with four basic tasks:
					<br /><br />
					<ul>
						<li>To establish good communication between themselves and the general members.</li>
						<li>To strengthen the connection between continental Europe, the UK, and the US.</li>
						<li>To maintain the clear, high standards that Sensei has developed for teachers.</li>
						<li>To stimulate the growth of the art by providing strong support for the teacher-student relationship.</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					The foundation of this work, through which all this comes into being, is sincere, committed, non-competitive practice. We train daily in our dojos, at seminars, and in our daily lives. It is Sensei's hope, and the hope of all his teachers, that the creation of Birankai International will ensure the transmission of Aikido into the future. The very name, "Birankai" carries inside it that hope: it means, as Sensei has explained elsewhere, the wind that blows before a great change: a cosmic wind.
					<br /><br />
					For reasons of legal convenience, Birankai International has been registered in the US as a nonprofit educational corporation. It will have three offices: one in California, one in London, and one in Strasbourg. These offices will serve their local regions. Because conditions in the regions differ, the administration of the regions and the functioning of the Teaching Committees will be autonomous, but they will work together as required to protect the unity of Birankai International's objectives. 
					<br /><br />
					This unity of purpose is represented by two pieces of paper. The first is the Birankai passport, which dojos affiliated with Birankai International will be able to order from their offices to distribute to both kyu and dan ranked students. The passport will enable students to keep a record of their kyu ranks, dan ranks, and also of their seminars. The second is the Birankai International dan certificate, which may be issued for ranks from shodan through rokudan. It is in English, not Japanese, and in addition to the name of the student and the signature of the Technical Director of Birankai, there is a place on it for the name of the student's teacher and dojo or other organization. 
					<br /><br />
					In the US, students are being asked to make a small donation when they receive the passport. This will cover the printing costs, and help raise funds to defray some of Birankai International's other expenses. There will be no fee for the Birankai International dan certificate. It is Chiba Sensei's strong feeling that the issuance of the dan certificate, which symbolizes the teacher-student relationship, should not be corrupted by financial considerations. 
					<br /><br />
					This dan certificate is not in competition with certificates issued by Aikikai Hombu Dojo. Birankai International is in no way in opposition to Hombu Dojo. In December 2000, Chiba Sensei communicated directly with Moriteru Ueshiba, Doshu, regarding the creation and purposes of Birankai International Doshu responded immediately, expressing his understanding and offering his best wishes. Members affiliated with Birankai International wishing to receive Hombu Dojo dan certificates may do so, and the Birankai offices will assist them. Members wishing to receive both Birankai International and Hombu Dojo certificates may do so as well. 
					<br /><br />
					There is a third way in which Birankai International will protect the unity of purpose Sensei wishes it to have. That is in the establishment of shihan title. For many years, the shihan of the North American Continental Shihankai have been negotiating with Hombu Dojo to allow for the recognition of non-Japanese teachers as shihan. In order for Aikido to truly take root outside Japan, it must develop, support, and honor teachers native to the countries where it is practiced. Unfortunately, over time, it has become apparent that the issuance of shihan title to non-Japanese must be resolved without the direct assistance of Hombu Dojo. Therefore, Chiba Sensei has given shihan title to three of the senior teachers in Birankai International US.
					<br /><br />
					I hope this presentation has answered some of the questions people may have about Birankai International. For me personally, the birth of Birankai International is a great adventure. It has meant a chance to train with strangers and to re-discover what I already knew: that we are indeed members of a family, united by our lineage, our trust in one another, and our training.
					<br /><br />
					Thank you.
